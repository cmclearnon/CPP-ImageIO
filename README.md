# CPP-ImageIO
 Image Processing using C++

 Most image files (jpg, tif, gif, png, bmp, ...) are in a binary format, consisting of two parts: **Header** and **Data**.

 * **Header**: constrains information about the image in storage, e.g.,

    Storage format, dimensions, colour or grayscale, compressed or not, etc.

 * **Data**: refer to the pixel values of the image.

 We often represent digital images using 2-D arrays.
